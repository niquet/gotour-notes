# Go Tour Notes

## What is this repository?

This repository contains my personal notes and examples from Ardan Labs' "Ultimate Go Tour", a comprehensive primer for learning the Go programming language. It provides the complete syntax, idioms, implementation and specification of the language to show the mechanics of the language and the mechanical sympathies the language has for both the hardware and the operating system. My motivation was to dive deeper into Go and solidify my understanding of the language's specifics and idioms. These notes are meant to be revisited over time to help fill any knowledge gaps I may have.
